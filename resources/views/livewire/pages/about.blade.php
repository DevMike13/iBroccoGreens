        <p class="mb-5 text-justify"><span class="pr-16"></span>Welcome to iBroccoGreens, a web-based parameter monitoring and misting automation with cycle level harvest tracking for Calabrese broccoli microgreens in vertical soilless farming. To access the iBroccoGreens web system, you must first agree with the terms and conditions. If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you cannot access the iBroccoGreens web system.</p>
        <p class="mb-5 text-justify"><span class="pr-16"></span>The iBroccoGreens device is designed as an indoor vertical farming system equipped with four microgreens trays. The iBroccoGreens device integrates sensors, automation, and provides monitoring day-to-day parameters in real time such as soil moisture, soil pH, water pH, temperature and humidity to improve consistency in yield, reduce manual labor, optimize resource usage, and implement sustainable microgreens production. With automatic misting, ventilation, and lighting, the device ensures consistent growth conditions and reduces the risks of overwatering, uneven lighting, and mold contamination. The iBroccoGreens web system allows you to easily track cycle details, monitor harvest yields, and make data-driven decisions to improve productivity and efficiency. The web system also provides real-time notifications and SMS alerts to inform users when parameter conditions fall outside optimal ranges.</p>

        <p class="mb-5 text-justify"><span class="pr-16"></span>The iBroccoGreens System is designed to enhance innovation and sustainability in agriculture. The iBroccoGreens Team took inspiration from the growing challenges faced by local farmers in maintaining consistent and efficient microgreen production, particularly in vertical soilless farming. Observing how traditional methods often led to uneven growth, excessive water use, and manual labor inefficiencies, the team envisioned a smart farming solution that integrates IoT technology with automation. We wanted to create a solution that not only benefits farmers but also promotes awareness of smart farming technologies among students and local communities. The team focused on exploring how sensors, automation, and a web-based system that would work together to monitor and control plant growth conditions. We studied various environmental factors such as humidity, temperature, and misting intervals to identify the ideal setup for Calabrese broccoli microgreens. After some trials and adjustments, the iBroccoGreens prototype is capable of automating misting schedules and monitoring vital parameters. The prototype was later integrated with a web system that allowed users to remotely monitor data and manage the growing cycles.</p>
